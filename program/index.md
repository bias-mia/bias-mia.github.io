To be announced - we have an action packed day with technical, clinical, and industry speakers who will share their perspectives on what interpretability in AI means to them. We will also have two young researchers share their work and showcase what could be coming next! Finally, we will have everyone sit together in a panel discussion. 

The main categories (or tracks) of the different talks as well as their coloring can be adapted in the `_config.yml` file under `conference.talks.main_categories`. See also the [Talk Settings](https://github.com/DigitaleGesellschaft/jekyll-theme-conference/#talk-settings-main-categories) section of the theme's README file.
