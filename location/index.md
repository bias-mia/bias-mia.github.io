You can adapt the design as well as the section shown on the map by copying the `assets/js/main.js` from the theme's repository and editing it. See also the subsection [Location / Room Overview](https://github.com/DigitaleGesellschaft/jekyll-theme-conference/#location--room-overview) section of the theme's README file.
